Project Title: Change in Crime Rate Over Time After the Legalization of Marijuana in the State of WA

Team Members: Victoria Chou, Acca Cheung, Kenneth Wong, Lawrence Tsai, Maybo Li

Project Description/Outline: Our objective is to track the change in crime rate over time before (2010-2012) and after( 2014 until now) the legalization of marijuana in the state of WA. We will see if there is a positive or negative association between the legalization and crime rates at the county and state level, and also compare it to the national average. We also want to compare the concentration of marijuana stores/sales to crime rate and income level by county or zipcode.

Research Questions to Answer:
-	How has the legalization of marijuana affected crime rates in WA over time at the county and state level? What is the average crime rate in WA compared to the nationwide average?
-	Has marijuana sales in WA increased overtime, and how do the sales look when you segment the sales by county or city type (rural, urban, suburban)? Are crime rates lower or higher in areas of greater marijuana sales?
-	How do the concentration of marijuana sales/stores at the county/zipcode level compare to crime rate and income level?
