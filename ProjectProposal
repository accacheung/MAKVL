Project Title: Change in Crime Rate Over Time After the Legalization of Marijuana in the State of WA

Team Members: Victoria Chou, Acca Cheung, Kenneth Wong, Lawrence Tsai, Maybo Li

Project Description/Outline: Our objective is to see if there was a change in crime rate before and after the first sale of legal recreational marijuana in the State of Washington, and if the change in crime rate was statistically significant. We will also explore crime rate at the county and county type (urban, suburban, rural) levels. Additionally, we will see if there is an overlap in areas of greater crime rate, and marijuana stores/sales.

Research Questions to Answer:
- Has there been a change in crime rate since the legalization of recreational marijuana in the state of WA? Is the change statistically significant?
- Are crime rates lower or higher in areas of higher marijuana sales or concentration of dispensaries at the county and/or county type level (urban, suburban, rural)?
